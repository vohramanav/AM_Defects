\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

In this section, we provide relevant details pertaining to the construction of the surrogate for the field of interest, i.e. the
residual stress in the AM part cross-section using the PCAS method in~\ref{sub:surr}. The surrogate is used to map
the process control parameters and the material properties to the residual stress field. The computational efficiency
enabled by the surrogate is exploited to perform a global sensitivity analysis of the inputs in~\ref{sub:gsa}. Finally, the
surrogate is used for reliability prediction for the AM part by estimating the probability of failure based on residual stress
in~\ref{sub:reliability}.
